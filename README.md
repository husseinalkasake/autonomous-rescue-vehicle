**Autonomous Rescue Vehicle**

This project is for a 3rd year engineering project of building an autonomous path following rescue robot.

GET STARTED

Project was created using PlatformIO (for convinience since its built on VS Code)

If you want to use their IDE/Framework can follow steps below
1. Install PlatformIO CLI https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/installation.html
2. Install IDE extension https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/vscode.html

**ALTERNATIVELY** - To Not Use PlatformIO and Use Arduino IDE instead, Ignore all this and simply copy code from `main.cpp` to an Arduino IDE sketch and run/upload there. Final code will be contained in `main.cpp` anyway.

**PlatformIO commands**

Build - `platformio run`

Build and Upload Firmware - `platformio run --target upload`

Clean - `platformio run --target clean`

Build (only Uno) - `platformio run -e uno`

Build and Upload Firmware (only Uno) - `platformio run -e uno -t upload`
